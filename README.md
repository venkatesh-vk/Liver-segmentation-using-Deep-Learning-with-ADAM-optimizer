# Liver-segmentation-using-Deep-Learning-with-ADAM-optimizer

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform liver segmentation using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the U-Net architecture. Liver segmentation is a crucial step in medical image analysis, as it can assist in diagnosing liver diseases, planning surgeries, and monitoring treatment progress. The U-Net architecture is well-suited for image segmentation tasks, making it a valuable tool for this project.

## Dataset Format

- **Input Scans:** The dataset should include the input CT or MRI scans in the .nii format. These scans serve as the raw medical images to be processed by the U-Net model.

- **Ground Truth Labels:** Alongside the input scans, the dataset should provide corresponding ground truth labels for liver segmentation, also in the .nii format. These labels serve as the reference for training and evaluation.

## Customization and Adaptation

Feel free to explore and adapt the provided code for your specific dataset and requirements. The U-Net architecture, combined with deep learning techniques, offers a powerful and flexible solution for liver segmentation tasks in medical image analysis.

## Code Implementation

For a more detailed code implementation, please refer to the Python script files in the project directory. The code contains instructions on how to load and preprocess the .nii format data, set up the U-Net architecture, train the model, and perform liver segmentation.

Use this information as a guide to work with your own liver segmentation dataset and leverage the power of deep learning to assist in medical image analysis and diagnosis.

If you encounter any specific issues or require further assistance with your dataset or project, feel free to seek help or guidance from the project documentation or community resources.

## Required Packages

To build and execute this project successfully, you will need the following Python packages:

- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework that provides tools for building and training deep neural networks. It is used here to implement the U-Net architecture.

- **Keras**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow. It simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models, including U-Net.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It is essential for array operations and data manipulation.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is useful for visualizing the input images, ground truth labels, and segmentation results.

- **Nibabel**: Nibabel is a library for reading and writing neuroimaging data formats like NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative). It is crucial for handling medical image data in .nii file format.

- **scikit-image**: scikit-image is an image processing library that provides algorithms for tasks such as image segmentation, feature extraction, and image analysis. It can be handy for pre-processing and post-processing steps.
